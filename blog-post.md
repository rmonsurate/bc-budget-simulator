# WTF Happened to BC's Budget?

*In 1971, 8 cents of every healthcare dollar went to administration. Today it's 22 cents. The bureaucracy is the deficit.*

If you've seen [wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com), you know the story: productivity and wages decoupled, costs exploded, and working people got squeezed. The same forces that broke the national economy calcified into provincial bureaucracy — and BC's 2026 budget is the receipt.

**$85.8 billion in spending. $72.5 billion in revenue. A $13.3 billion deficit** — the largest in provincial history.

The government's solution? Raise the lowest income tax bracket and freeze indexing for four years. Tax the salary earners harder. Leave the bureaucracy untouched.

There's a better way.

## The Calcification

In 1971, when boomers were entering the workforce, BC healthcare administration consumed about **8% of spending**. Today it's **22%**. Education admin was 6%. Now it's 17%.

This isn't gradual evolution. It's calcification. Every decade added another layer — more compliance officers, more project managers, more directors of directors. Each layer justified by the complexity the previous layer created.

The numbers:

- **Health Authority Admin**: **$3.8B/year**, 95% pure overhead — executives, corporate services, IT projects like the **$799M CST boondoggle** (Ontario built comparable for half)
- **Fraser Health** blew its budget by **$1.1 billion** (20%) in a single year
- **K-12 Education**: **3,080 administrators** for 37,000 teachers — **1 admin per 12 teachers**. In 1971 it was 1 per 25. We added 339 admin positions since 2016 alone
- **Post-Secondary Admin**: $1.2B/year, 92% administrative
- **Every single ministry** runs an admin line item at 85-95% overhead

Total administrative spend across the provincial budget: roughly **$18 billion per year**. That's more than the entire deficit.

The boomers who entered a lean workforce in the '70s spent 50 years building and expanding these bureaucracies. The structures are now self-perpetuating — every admin hires more admins, every compliance requirement spawns a compliance team, every IT project needs a project management office that needs a director that needs an executive assistant. The people aren't villains. The system is.

## The Wrong People Are Paying

The 2026 budget raised the **lowest personal income tax bracket** from 5.06% to 5.60% — hitting **1.68 million British Columbians** earning under $47,937. A tax credit offsets it below ~$45K, but the $45K–$95K middle class — **920,000 people** — eats the full increase.

Bracket indexing is **frozen 2027–2030**. Inflation will silently push everyone into higher effective rates. It's a stealth tax on anyone who earns a salary.

Meanwhile, the corporate rate sits at 12% and the PST stays at 7%.

This is backwards. People who earn their income as a salary — nurses, teachers, tradespeople, engineers, baristas — **can't dodge their tax bracket.** They can't offshore income, defer through holding companies, or expense their lives through a corp. They pay what the bracket says, every paycheque.

The policy should be obvious: **lower income taxes on salary earners, raise corporate taxes, and use AI to gut the administrative bloat that's eating the budget.**

## What I'd Do

Hit the **"My Budget"** preset in the simulator below to see this in action:

**1. Slash admin with AI.** Cut pure-admin line items by 85%. Automate scheduling, billing, compliance, reporting, procurement, and HR. The technology exists today. One admin per 12 teachers is a joke — 1 per 50 is achievable with modern tooling. Savings: **$7-8 billion.**

**2. Fund the frontline.** Redirect every admin dollar to hiring actual doctors, nurses, teachers, and social workers. More hospital beds, not hospital administrators. More classrooms, not compliance officers.

**3. Cut every personal income tax bracket.** Lower rates across the board — from the lowest bracket down to 4.5% through to the top bracket. Unfreeze indexing. People who work for a living should keep more of what they earn.

**4. Raise corporate tax to 15%.** BC's 12% rate is a gift. A 3-point increase generates ~$1.3B. Corporations benefit from BC's educated workforce and infrastructure — they can pay for it.

**5. Drop PST to 5%.** Sales tax is regressive — low-income families spend a higher share of income on taxable goods. Cut it from 7% to 5%. The admin savings more than cover the gap.

The result? **Lower deficit, lower personal taxes, lower sales tax, more frontline workers, less bureaucracy.** The math works because $18 billion in admin overhead is an absurd amount of money to spend on people who don't teach, don't treat patients, and don't build anything.

## Try It Yourself

I built an interactive simulator where you can test this — or any scenario you want. Every slider updates the deficit in real-time.

**[Open the full simulator →](https://bcbudget2026.monsurate.com)**

Hit **"My Budget"** to load the scenario above. Or try **"1975 Admin"** to see what pre-calcification levels look like. The **Admin Analysis** tab shows the 50-year trend in chart form.

Pull apart healthcare, education, housing, public safety — every sector. The green/red bars under each line item show how much goes to frontline services vs administration.

## The Real Problem

We don't have a revenue problem. We have an allocation problem that's been compounding since 1971.

$18 billion a year in admin overhead. A bureaucratic structure that nearly tripled in relative size while working people's wages stagnated. And the government's answer is to raise taxes on the lowest earners and hope nobody notices the frozen indexing.

AI changes the equation. For the first time in 50 years, we have a tool that can actually replace the administrative machinery — not with more administrators, but with systems that schedule, report, comply, and coordinate without needing a corner office and a pension.

Cut the overhead. Fund the frontline. Lower taxes on working people. It's not complicated — it's just not what the people who benefit from 50 years of bureaucratic expansion want to hear.
